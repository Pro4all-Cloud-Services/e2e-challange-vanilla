## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v22.14 or later)
  `nvm install 22.14`
  `nvm use 22.14`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone** this repository (or download the source).
2. **Install dependencies**:

   `npm install`

   or

   `yarn`

   **Install playwright**:

   `npx playwright install`

---

## Running the App

1. **Serve** the app locally:

   `npm run dev`

   It will compile and run the React app on **<http://localhost:5173/>** by default.

2. **Open** your browser at <http://localhost:5173/>.

---

## Running the Tests

We use **Cucumber** + **Playwright** for E2E tests. The tests are located in the **src/tests** folder

### Run the tests

1. In one terminal (if you don't have the app running already):

   `npm run dev`

2. In another terminal:

   `npm run e2e`

---

## Adding New Steps and Features

You can add or modify test scenarios in the **Cucumber feature files** and **step definitions** under:

```
  src/
    tests/
      features/  <-- .feature files here
      steps/     <-- .steps.ts files here
```

- **Feature Files**: Write your Gherkin (`.feature`) scenarios in `features/`.
- **Step Definitions**: Implement the test logic in `.steps.ts` files under `steps/`.
- **Addional Objects**: Feel free to structure any Page Object Model (POM) elements however you prefer.

When you run `npm run e2e`, it will execute all scenarios in `features/` and use the step definitions in `steps/`.

---

## Instructions

1. Add some end-to-end tests in a way you believe is most efficient.

2. You can use the blank feature and step files as a starting point, but feel free to create your own approach if you prefer.

3. Creating a Page Object Model (POM) to assist your tests if you want to, this is not mandatory.

4. Avoid modifying the applicationâ€™s source files directly, if possible.

**Happy Testing!**
